# When to Build Custom vs Use Frameworks

Decision framework for API-to-database integrations.

## The Industry Standard Pattern (2024-2025)

**Most production teams use:**
```
Extraction Tool (Airbyte/Fivetran/Meltano) → PostgreSQL → dbt Transformations
```

**NOT:**
```
Custom Python Scripts → PostgreSQL
```

## Framework Decision Matrix

| Factor | Use Framework | Build Custom |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| **Source System** | Common SaaS (Salesforce, NetSuite, Stripe) | Proprietary/internal APIs |
| **Data Volume** | < 10M rows/month | > 10M rows/month (cost-sensitive) |
| **Team Size** | Small (1-3 engineers) | Dedicated data engineering team |
| **Time to Market** | Days-weeks | Months acceptable |
| **Customization Needs** | Standard field mappings | Complex business logic |
| **Budget** | Flexible | Cost-conscious at scale |
| **Maintenance Tolerance** | Low (prefer managed) | High (engineering investment) |

## When Custom Python Mappers Make Sense

**✅ Build custom mappers when:**
1. No existing connector (niche SaaS, internal systems)
2. Complex transformation logic (multi-source joins, calculations)
3. Unique incremental sync patterns
4. Data integration IS your product differentiator
5. NetSuite/Salesforce customizations not supported by connectors
6. Real-time requirements (event-driven, not batch)
7. Large data volumes make per-row pricing prohibitive

**❌ Avoid custom code when:**
1. Standard SaaS integration (NetSuite vendors/transactions)
2. Simple field mappings (API field → database column)
3. Limited engineering resources
4. Fast time-to-market required
5. Existing Airbyte/Meltano/Singer connector exists
6. No unique requirements justifying maintenance burden

## Framework Comparison

### Airbyte (Recommended for Most Use Cases)

**Pros:**
- 600+ connectors (NetSuite, Salesforce included)
- Open-source (self-hosted) or managed cloud
- Active community, frequent updates
- Free for self-hosted, pay-per-use for cloud
- Schema drift detection
- Incremental sync built-in

**Cons:**
- Self-hosted requires infrastructure management
- Cloud pricing scales with volume
- Customization requires forking connectors

**Best for:** Teams wanting pre-built connectors without Fivetran cost

### Meltano/Singer (Code-Centric Approach)

**Pros:**
- 300+ Singer taps available
- Git-based, reproducible pipelines
- CLI-first developer experience
- Full control, no vendor lock-in
- Free and open-source

**Cons:**
- More operational overhead than Airbyte
- Connector quality varies (community-maintained)
- Requires Python/DevOps expertise

**Best for:** Teams prioritizing reproducibility and full control

### Fivetran (Fastest, Highest Cost)

**Pros:**
- 500+ connectors, enterprise-grade
- Fully managed (zero infrastructure)
- Automatic schema drift handling
- Enterprise SLAs and support
- Fastest time-to-production

**Cons:**
- High per-row pricing
- Limited customization
- Vendor lock-in

**Best for:** Teams with budget, limited engineering, fast deadlines

### dbt (Transformations, Not Extraction!)

**Critical:** dbt does NOT extract from APIs. It's for transforming data **after** it's loaded.

**Use dbt for:**
- SQL-based transformations within warehouse
- Modeling dimensional tables from raw data
- Testing and documentation
- Collaboration across technical/non-technical users

**dbt complements extraction tools, doesn't replace them.**

## Our Current Approach: Custom Python

**What we've built:**
- libs.netsuite: Client, auth, queries, field utils
- libs.database: Models, mappers (DimVendor, FactVendorBill, DimCustomer, FactInvoice)
- Incremental sync with high-water marks
- JSONB custom fields for schema resilience
- Factory methods for transformations

**Justification checklist:**
- ✅ NetSuite customizations (custom fields with lifecycle metadata)
- ✅ Specific incremental sync logic (>= for date-only precision)
- ✅ Read-only enforcement critical
- ✅ Learning/control valuable
- ⚠️ Maintenance burden acceptable?
- ⚠️ Could Airbyte NetSuite connector work?

## Hybrid Recommendation

**Consider this evolution:**

1. **Now (Custom Python):**
   - Keep for learning and control
   - Document patterns in skills
   - Share libraries across apps ✓

2. **Next (Add dbt):**
   - Keep custom extraction
   - Add dbt for transformations (vendor analysis, revenue trends)
   - Get testing and documentation benefits

3. **Future (Evaluate Airbyte):**
   - Test Airbyte NetSuite connector alongside custom code
   - Migrate if it handles 80% of needs
   - Keep custom code for unique 20%

## Bottom Line

**Custom Pydantic + SQLAlchemy mappers are justified when:**
- You have unique requirements (we do: custom fields lifecycle, specific sync logic)
- You're learning data engineering patterns (educational value)
- Maintenance burden is acceptable (code is well-structured, shared libraries)

**But watch for:**
- Spending time on undifferentiated infrastructure
- Reinventing solutions to solved problems
- Missing features that frameworks provide (monitoring, alerting, schema drift)

The industry standard is frameworks for common integrations. Custom code is the exception, not the rule.
